    "### Brief review of Git related concepts:\n",
    "Before jumping into the demo, let's try to level the ground on some basic concepts. What is...?\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``Git``: <br>\n",
    "Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to track changes in code and other files, allowing multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously. It provides a structured and efficient way to manage and collaborate on software development by keeping track of code history, enabling branching and merging, and facilitating collaboration among team members.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``Repository``: <br>\n",
    "A repository, often referred to as a \"repo,\" is a storage location where all the files and version history of a project are stored. It can be thought of as a folder or directory that contains all the code, documents, and assets for a specific project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``Initialization``: <br>\n",
    "Initialization typically refers to the process of setting up a new repository or project with version control using Git. When you initialize a repository, Git creates a hidden directory called \".git\" in the project's root directory. This directory contains all the necessary files and data to track changes and manage version history for your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``Branch``: <br>\n",
    "A branch in Git is a separate line of development that diverges from the main codebase, allowing multiple developers to work on different features, fixes, or experiments simultaneously. Each branch represents a copy of the project's code, and changes made in one branch do not immediately affect other branches. Branches are used to isolate and manage code changes, making it easier to collaborate on and organize the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``Commit``: <br>\n",
    "A commit is a snapshot of the changes made to the files in a Git repository at a specific point in time. Each commit represents a set of changes (additions, deletions, or modifications) made by a developer. Commits are accompanied by a commit message that describes the purpose or context of the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``Push``:<br>\n",
    "Pushing in Git refers to the action of uploading your local commits to a remote repository. It is typically used to share your local changes with others or to synchronize your work with a central repository. When you push, your commits become part of the remote repository's history.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``Pull``:<br>\n",
    "Pulling in Git is the process of fetching and merging changes from a remote repository into your local repository. It's used to update your local copy of a repository with changes made by other collaborators. A \"pull\" combines the \"fetch\" (retrieving changes) and \"merge\" (combining changes) operations into a single step.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``Pull Request``:<br>\n",
    "A pull request (often abbreviated as PR) is a feature primarily associated with Git hosting platforms like GitHub and GitLab. It is a way for developers to propose changes to a repository's codebase. When you create a pull request, you are requesting that the repository's owner or maintainers review and potentially merge your changes into the main branch. Pull requests provide a collaborative and structured way to manage code contributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``GitHub``: <br>\n",
    "GitHub is a web-based platform and hosting service that enhances collaboration and version control for software development projects. It leverages the Git version control system to provide a centralized location for developers to store, manage, and collaborate on code repositories. GitHub offers a wide range of features to facilitate code sharing, issue tracking, code review, and project management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brief review of Jenkins related concepts:\n",
    "Before jumping into the demo, let's try to level the ground on some basic concepts. What is...?\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``Jenkins``: <br>\n",
    "Jenkins is an open-source automation server that is widely used in DevOps and software development processes. It provides a platform for automating various tasks related to building, testing, and deploying software. Jenkins helps streamline the development and delivery pipeline by enabling continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``Pipeline``: <br>\n",
    "Jenkins Pipelines are a key feature that enable you to define and manage your CI/CD processes as code. They offer a structured way to automate and orchestrate the steps involved in building, testing, and deploying software. Jenkins Pipelines are typically written in a domain-specific language called Groovy and can be version-controlled alongside your application code."

    "This is a short demo so not all features of these apps are shown; but one of the key pieces to mention is that we could:\n",
    "- Set GitHub to protect a specific branch so any merge happens through a code review process\n",
    "- Set GitHub to scan our code for hardcoded passords\n",
    "- Set GitHub to call Jenkins through a 'webhook' everytime our 'main' branch is updated\n",
    "- Jenkins would not just automatically deploy to production, but it would also updte the support instance for immediate remediation (if needed)\n",
    "- Jenkins can run server and environmental checks before and after deployement\n",
    "- Jenkins pipeline could also be part of a Muticonfiguration pipeline that would be called when source system have been deployed\n",
    "- Launch RushTi scripts to test the recently deployed code\n",
    "- Call DataSync to update cubes\n"

    "1. Enterprise direction: most big organizations have this implemented already and it's a matter of time since they demand TM1 behaves as all the other enterprise tool.\n",
    "2. IBM direction: this approach, though not 100% identical, is they approach that IBM is taking with v12. There will no longer be files to move, nor scripts to run inside the server (as there are no more servers). This is future prove. "
